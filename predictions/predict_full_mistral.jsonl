The foundational element is the rotamer density estimator (RDE), a conditional normalizing flow that calculates the conditional probability density of sidechain conformations (rotamers) based on the amino acid type and environmental factors (Section 3.2). Subsequently, there is the approach for assessing the entropy of the distribution, which is parameterized using the normalizing flow (Section 3.3). Lastly, we demonstrate the application of estimating the change in binding free energy (\u2206\u2206 G) upon mutation using the entropy of the mutated and wild-type protein-protein interfaces in both bound and unbound states (Section 3.4). A protein-protein complex is described as a multipartite structure composed of two distinct groups. Each group contains at least one protein chain, and each chain encompasses multiple amino acids. For a protein complex consisting of n amino acids, we assignindices 1 to n. The protein complex's two groups can be expressed as two separate sets of indices, A and B, which are subsets of {1, \u2026, n}. An amino acid is denoted by its chemical type, position, orientation, and conformational state, referred to as its sidechain or rotamer. The position, orientation, and chemical type are denoted as i, where i \u2208 {1, \u2026, n}, the sidechain conformation as a set of torsional angles, w, relative to the rotatable bonds. The torsional angle count varies from 0 to 4, contingent on the amino acid type. For an amino acid with d torsional angles, we refer to the k-th (k \u2208 {1, \u2026, 4}) torsional angle as \u03c7(k)i and its value as a point on the unit circle S1. The collection of all torsional angles forms a d-dimensional vector, \u03c7i, where d is the number of torsional angles. Employing the terminology of geometry, an angle may be conceptualized as a point on the unit circle S1, while a vector composed of d angular values resides on the d-dimensional torus TD = (S1)d.", "type_approach": "instruction-annot_1"}

Revise this paragraph for clarity.", "revised_paragraph": " Revised paragraph:\n\nOverview Our method consists of three parts. The core component is the rotamer density estimator (RDE), a conditional normalizing flow that models the probability density of residue conformations (rotamers) given the residue type and environments (Section 3.2). Next is the algorithm for estimating the entropy of the distribution parameterized by the normalizing flow (Section 3.3). Finally, we demonstrate how to use the entropy of the mutated and wild-type protein-protein interfaces at both bound and unbound states to estimate the change in binding free energy (\u2206\u2206 G) upon mutation, and how to use neural networks to predict \u2206\u2206 G more accurately using the unsupervised representations from the RDE (Section 3.4). A protein-protein complex is a multi-chain protein structure that can be divided into two groups. Each group contains at least one protein chain, and each chain is composed of multiple residues. For a protein complex consisting of n residues, we label them from 1 to n. The two groups of the complex can be represented by two disjoint sets of indices A, B \u2282 {1, \u2026, n}. A residue is characterized by its type, position, orientation, and sidechain conformation. We denote the type, position, and orientation of the i-th (i \u2208 {1, \u2026, n}) residue as a vector ai \u2208 {1, \u2026, 20} for its type, pi \u2208 \u211d\u00b3 for its position, and Oi \u2208 SO(3) for its orientation, respectively. The sidechain conformation of the residue is referred to as a rotamer. As the conformational degree of freedom of the sidechain is defined by rotatable bonds, a rotamer can be sufficiently parameterized by torsional angles w.r.t. the rotatable bonds. The number of torsional angles varies between 0 to 4 depending on the residue type. For a residue with d torsional angles, we denote the k-th (k \u2208 {1, \u2026, 4}) torsional angle by \u03c7k i \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0). Collectively, all the torsional angles are denoted by a vector \u03c7i = (\u03c7k i)dk = 1. In geometric terms, an angle can be represented by a point on the unit circle S1. A vector consisting of d angular values resides on the product of d unit circles, known as the d-dimensional torus TD = (S1)D.", "type_approach": "instruction-annot_2"}

This disparity arises due to their reliance on element order, which makes them less data-efficient. Notably, non-equivariant models are unlikely to exhibit substantial improvement with increased training data beyond 1x and 10x, as they have already overfit on these scales.\"", "type_approach": "instruction-annot_2"}

Nonetheless, obstacles persist in developing deep learning-based models capable of predicting the impact of mutations on protein-protein binding. The primary impediment is the paucity of accessible experimental data; fewer than a few thousand protein mutations, annotated with altered binding affinities, have been made publicly available (Geng et al., 2019b). This data deficiency hampers supervised learning, as the scarcity of training data tends to result in overfitting. An additional challenge is the lack of structure information regarding mutated protein-protein complexes. Mutations to a protein complex result in changes to sidechain conformations (rotamers) (Najmanovich et al., 2000; Gaudreault et al., 2012).

The main obstacle is the difficulty of pruning residual connections, which are extensively used in state-of-the-art SR networks (for instance, EDSR (Lim et al., 2017) incorporates 32 residual blocks, while RCAN (Zhang et al., 2018b) employs nested residual blocks).\n\nReferences:\n- Reed, M.

In the context of acceleration, researchers have predominantly focused on filter pruning, also known as structured pruning (Li et al., 2017), in contrast to weight-element pruning, or unstructured pruning (Han et al., 2015, 2016b). The combination of filter pruning and image super-resolution (SR) appears to be a promising approach for achieving a favorable performance-complexity trade-off. However, directly applying filter pruning methods to SR networks poses challenges. The primary impediment is the presence of residual connections, which are widely utilized in state-of-the-art SR architectures (e.g., EDSR (Lim et al., 2017) incorporates 32 residual blocks; RCAN (Zhang et al., 2018b) implements nested residual blocks).

To preserve the expressive abilities of the unimportant filters, we employ L2 regularization to encourage the weights' convergence towards zero, enabling their eventual removal with minimal performance loss. We demonstrate the practicability of SRP by training efficient image SR networks, which include the lightweight version SPRN-Lite and the deep counterpart SPRN. A comprehensive comparison with both lightweight and larger image SR networks is conducted, and the results indicate that SPRN-Lite and SPRN deliver superior performance improvements over contemporary methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.\"", "type_approach": "instruction-annot_2"}

The findings from Experiment 1 suggested that the notch lengthened the pointing movement time in certain circumstances. The results of Experiment 2 indicated that dodging the notch altogether proved more advantageous than attempting to navigate through it in the current version of the notch. Experiment 3 disclosed that relocating the notch to an area where the cursor is unable to enter significantly improves the speed and precision of target-pointing when the desired target is adjacent to the notch.

This shortcoming becomes particularly concerning when considering safety-critical applications, such as self-driving cars. For instance, a well-trained object detection model, proficient in recognizing in-distribution objects (e.g., cars, stop signs), may confidently predict an unseen, yet significant outlier, such as a moose (see Figure 1a).

This enhanced alignment results from optimal transport's capability to learn an adaptive transport plan, effectively achieving fine-grained matching across modalities. We assess our method on 11 datasets conforming to the standard settings of CLIP [39] and CoOp [63].

Two primary factors influencing movement time are target size and distance from the initial cursor position to the target [11, 19]. Movement time generally increases as the distance and decreases in target size. Moreover, the presence of distractors on the path to the target, which do not conceal the cursor, increases movement time due to the user's careful navigation around them [6, 23]. The introduction of a notch can lead to increased movement time in several ways. First, a user might miss the cursor's position within the notch or lose sight of the cursor, forcing them to avoid or approach the notch cautiously [11, 24]. In Experiment 1, long movement times were observed when the cursor was hidden behind a notch while pointing to a target at the top edge, which was also located at the top edge. Additionally, smaller targets or larger distances from the initial cursor position to the target, as well as the presence of distractors, could exacerbate these effects.", "type_approach": "instruction-annot_1"}

Pointing should be fast and efficient, with target size and distance being the primary factors influencing movement time [11,19]. Previous studies have shown that the movement time increases as the target size decreases and the distance from the starting position of the cursor to the target increases [6,23]. Additionally, placing distractors along the path to the target can also increase movement time. Here, we introduced a notch between two targets positioned at the same horizontal level. By placing a notch, a user could potentially miss the cursor position within the notch or lose sight of the cursor, which may increase movement time as the user avoids the notch or moves the mouse cursor carefully around it. Specifically, longer movement times were recorded when pointing to a target located at the top edge from another target that was also at the top edge, with the cursor being hidden by the notch during the pointing action.\"", "type_approach": "instruction-annot_2"}

Notable surveys on the use of TL in reinforce learning (RL) have been presented in works [17, 18, 19]. However, these approaches encounter the exploration problem. To address this, the authors of [20, 21] learn finite state automata from demonstrations and employ them to guide planning using the value iteration network, thereby avoiding exploration.

Researchers in [22, 24] have made strides in learning linear temporal logic (LTL) formulas from demonstrations, and reward machines (an automata-like reward presentation) from demonstrations, respectively. A shared trait among these methods is their reliance on LTL that operates on propositions or binary variables. This implies a necessity for high-level demonstrations or a mapping from low-level states to propositions, thereby limiting their applicability to discrete and finite state and action spaces.

Our study centers on linear predictors due to their analogy with previous analysis. We extend matching results to bound regret and sample complexity for learning dual linear predictors. Page migration poses a challenge due to output simplicity constraints. We address this by limiting matrices to those with columns in the simplex, leading to rectangular stochastic matrices.

Our analysis includes linear predictors, which are frequently comparable to the mentioned analyses due to their convex and affine nature. For instance, we can bound the regret and sample complexity of learning a dual using these predictors. Page migration poses a challenge, as outputs must lie within the simplex, which is mitigated by restricting to rectangular stochastic matrices.
